### About Me
Hello and welcome to my Data Analytics Portfolio! My name is Anthony Stark, and I am a student in a six-month intensive bootcamp, working towards developing core data analytics skills. 

I have a background in biochemistry, winemaking, and physics education, and I began my journey into the field of data in October 2022. 

Based in San Diego, I am passionate about exploring and analyzing data, as well as other activities such as surfing, traveling, and BBQ. 

In this portfolio, you will find a showcase of my skills and projects, highlighting my journey into the exciting world of data analytics.
